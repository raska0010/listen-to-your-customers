### Analysing online reviews to refine business' service quality


**Introduction**

In this repository we will analyse YELP online reviews to refine restaurant quality. 
<br>
This is devided in two steps: Taking a closer look to the business attributes, if there is a correlation between the attributes and star ranking.
In the second step the sentiment analysis is in the center of attention. To get to know if we can implement the customer reviews to improve the star ranking of restaurants.

**First of all: Let's clean the data!**
<br>
First we downloaded the Dataset provided by Yelp.com

Then we took a look at the business dataframe and cleaned it.
Since 39% of customers trust a business with at least 3.5 stars and 79% of customers trust a business with at least 4 stars, we decided to take a closer look to the 3.5 star ranked restaurants in Pennsylvania. Why Penssylvania? Since there are the most reviewed restaurants in the US we will have a lot of data and reviews to analyse.
